# core2 speedo

## A speedometer for your bike using the M5 Stack Core 2

I made this in addition to my TTGO speedometer because I find it easier to mount on a bike.

Usage:

You'll need a grove connector and a GPS module. Pin 32 should be wired to the TX line on a GPS module. The power from the Grove should be wired to it as well.

It expects the clock is already set.

Tap the left virtual button to switch units between miles and kilometers

Tap the middle virtual button to switch to the stat/location screen and back

Tap the right virtual button to reset the trip/time counters

Tap the screen itself (on the main screen) to switch between full and big modes.

Sats line on status screen is satellites in use vs in view
